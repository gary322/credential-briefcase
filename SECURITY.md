# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Email: `gary@alien.international`

Include:

- a clear description of the issue and impact
- minimal reproduction steps
- affected versions / commit hash
- any suggested fix or mitigation

## Supported Versions

This project follows a release-line support policy:

- The latest minor release line is fully supported (security + compatibility fixes).
- The previous minor release line receives security and compatibility fixes for one minor window.
- The `main` branch is not a supported deployment target; it exists for development and may change
  without notice.

## Response and Disclosure Timeline

- We aim to acknowledge reports within 2 business days.
- We aim to provide a remediation plan or mitigation guidance within 7 business days.
- For confirmed vulnerabilities, we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter.
  A 90-day disclosure window is the default unless risk/impact warrants a shorter timeline.
